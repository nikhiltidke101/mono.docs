## ðŸ‘‰ Getting started

If you are new to DevRev, we would recommend learning about our [core concepts](https://docs.devrev.ai/intro) before getting started.

Once you have a DevRev account, you can access the APIs with a [personal access token](/about/authentication) (PAT) that you create in the DevRev app.

A brief [tutorial](/api-reference/getting-started) shows you how to access the APIs.

## ðŸ§¬ Methods

Specifications covering the supported APIs are based on OpenAPI Specification 3.0. You can download the specs to use an OpenAPI 3.0-compliant tool to perform a variety of actions, including rendering them in UI and generating SDKs. Two [versions](/about/versioning) of the DevRev API are available: [public](/public) and [beta](/beta) (early access). Use the drop-down menu in the upper-left corner of this site to switch between versions.

To take action based on events from the DevRev platform, [webhooks](/guides/webhooks) are also supported.
